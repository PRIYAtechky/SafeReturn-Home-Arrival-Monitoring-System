## **Problem Statement**
The rising number of kidnapping cases, averaging **294 per day**, and a murder rate of **78 per day** in India poses a significant safety concern, especially for:
- School-age children
- Working individuals
- People who travel alone

There is a critical need for a system that tracks when individuals leave and return home, raising alerts if they fail to return by a set time, ensuring timely intervention to enhance personal safety.

## **Proposed System**
An application that records when a person leaves for work and when they return home.  
If they do not return by a set deadline, the app will:
- **Alert** the nearest police station.
- **Send notifications** to designated contacts.
- Provide **voice access** for easy updates and alerts.

### **Features**
1. **Real-Time Tracking & Automated Alerts:** Continuously monitors users and sends alerts if they do not return by the set deadline.
2. **Voice Access:** Allows users to control the app using voice commands for hands-free interaction.
3. **Police Station Alerts:** The nearest police station will be alerted for prompt assistance in case of an emergency.
